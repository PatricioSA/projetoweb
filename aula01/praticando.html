    <h1>A INFORMATICA NA EDUCAÇÃO CONTRIBUINDO PARA
        O PROCESSO DE REVITALIZAÇÃO ESCOLAR</h1>

    <h2>Resumo</h2>
    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the 
        readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using 
        Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, 
        as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it <strong>look like readable</strong>
        English. <em>Many desktop publishing packages</em> and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum 
        as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web 
        sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, 
        sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 
        1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to 
        make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but 
        also the leap into <strong>electronic typesetting,</strong> remaining essentially unchanged. 
        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <u>Letraset sheets containing</u> 
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus 
        PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
